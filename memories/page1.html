                <h2>Baby Megan!</h2>
                <p>I think I am 3 years old here. My family used to
                    <br> have really huge family parties when
                    <br> we all lived in Long Beach, CA.
                    <br>I always remember the crazy amounts
                    <br> of food. As you can tell I was
                    <br> a big fan of the food since I was 
                    <br> a kid.</p>

                <h2>My sister <br> and me!</h2>
                <p>We are super close. I was only born 2 years 
                    <br> after her and we were always moving 
                    <br> schools so she became my best friend.</p>

                <h2>First Year of <br>College!</h2>
                <p>
                    I think I had such a nice experience for the first year
                    <br> of college. Being in a new city from where I grew 
                    <br> was a big change but I think it is the change I 
                    <br> needed. San Francisco is an amazing city with so 
                    <br> much to do compared to Portland, Oregon. It feels 
                    <br> like I can never get bored of this city, Truly I 
                    <br> think I fell in love with this city.

                <h2>Met some <br> great people</h2>
                <p>
                    I still think its crazy how many people I have met in 
                    <br> the past year. My roommate that was assigned to
                    <br> me is one of my closest friends. I was so nervous 
                    <br> about starting college classes but literally found 
                    <br> two friends thew moment I showed up to class.
                    <br> I have so many memories from my first year of 
                    <br> college that I hold so much happiness for that 
                    <br> school year.

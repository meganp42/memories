                <h2>My best friends<br> for life</h2>
                <p>I met them in 8th grade and we haven't left each
                    <br> others lives since then. We all go to
                    <br> colleges and live in different places 
                    <br> but always make time to talk to one another.

                <h2>Soulmate <br>Energy</h2>
                <p>Every time I see them it feels like no time has
                    <br> passed. Its crazy to believe that I have 
                    <br> known them for 6 years. We definitely don't 
                    <br> have 6 years worth of photos because it was 
                    <br> very hard to find a picture with all of us.
                    <br> I will never admit this to their faces but 
                    <br> I couldn't image a life without them. I love 
                    <br> them so much.

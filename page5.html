                <h2>Graduation Day!</h2>
                <p>
                    This was a very big day for me. To me it felt like the end of as 
                    <br>chapter in my life. I wasn't sure if my friends would keep in 
                    <br> touch and I was nervous but excited about living in a new city.
                    <br> That day it felt like I was going through the motions but it 
                    <br> not hit me that I was leaving high school so while eveyone was 
                    <br> sentimental I was treating this like any regular high school 
                    <br> assembly. This was during the pandemic so this photo is the 
                    <br>first time we were all together in a while.

                <h2>My favorite <br>photo of my <br>family</h2>
                <p>
                    For some weird reason I love this photo of my family.
                    <br>  I love how they came to support me and I always 
                    <br> remember how happy I was that day.

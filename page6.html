                <h2>Home Coffee <br>Roasters</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a new cafe I found near my
                    <br> apartment. They have such a nice 
                    <br> vibe in the store with amazing 
                    <br> drinks. This drink is there rose 
                    <br> latte that I found super cute.
                    <br> I am not a big coffee drinker so 
                    <br> my roommate likes it more than me 
                    <br> but the drink was too pretty not 
                    <br> to take a photo. I have yet to try 
                    <br> them all but I am excited to try 
                    <br> their red velvet latte the next 
                    <br> time I am there.

                <h2>Matcha Cafe <br> Maiko</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a big tea drinker especially 
                    <br> matcha drinks so when I found
                    <br> there was a matcha cafe near 
                    <br>I knew I had to go. For a simple
                    <br> drink they have so many options.
                    <br> I love getting my matcha with 
                    <br> strawberry or ube ice cream.
